# üê™ CamelUp

CamelUp is a light strategy game where players bet on camels racing to the finish line. The twist? Camels can land on each other, forming stacks that move together, making the race totally unpredictable!

## üé≤ How the Game Works

### One Leg of the Race

The game is divided into multiple legs, each consisting of several rounds. A leg continues until all five camels have moved at least once. Here's how one leg works:

1. **Roll the Dice:**
   - In each round, a player rolls a die corresponding to one of the camels. Each die has three possible results: 1, 2, or 3.
   - The camel with the corresponding color moves forward that many spaces on the track.
   - If a camel lands on a space occupied by another camel, it stacks on top of the camel(s) there. Stacked camels move together when the camel at the bottom moves.

2. **Betting on the Leg Winner:**
   - Players can place a bet on which camel they think will be leading at the end of the leg.
   - Each player has a set of Leg Betting cards for each camel (e.g., blue, red, yellow). The earlier you bet on a camel, the more money you can win if your bet is correct.
   - The first correct bet earns the highest reward, and subsequent correct bets earn slightly less. If you're wrong, you lose money!

3. **End of the Leg:**
   - The leg ends once all five camels have moved.
   - Payouts are calculated based on the Leg Betting cards, and then a new leg begins.

### Betting Cards

Betting is a crucial part of CamelUp. Here‚Äôs how the Leg Betting cards work:

- **Leg Betting Cards:** Each player has a set of these cards, one for each camel color.
  - On your turn, instead of rolling the dice, you can place a Leg Betting card.
  - The card represents your prediction for which camel will be leading at the end of the leg.
  - The earlier you place a card, the higher the potential reward:
    - First correct bet: 5 coins
    - Second correct bet: 3 coins
    - Third correct bet: 2 coins
  - Incorrect bets cost you 1 coin each.

Betting strategically is key to winning the game. Should you bet early for a higher reward, or wait to see how the race unfolds?
